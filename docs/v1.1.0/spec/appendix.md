### Test Vectors

The Resolution test vectors are the result of applying operations and obtaining resolution results.

- The Create Resolution is generated by applying the `Create Operation` input vector and then resolving `shortFormDid`.
- The Update Resolution is generated by applying the `Create Operation` followed by the `Update Operation` from the input vector and then resolving `shortFormDid`.
- The Recover Resolution is generated by applying the `Create Operation` followed by the `Recover Operation` from the input vector and then resolving `shortFormDid`.
- The Deactivate Resolution is generated by applying the `Create Operation` followed by the `Recover Operation` followed by the `Deactivate Operation` from the input vector and then resolving `shortFormDid`.
- The Long-Form Resolution is generated by resolving `longFormDid`.
