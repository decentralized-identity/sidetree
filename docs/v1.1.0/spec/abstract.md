## Abstract

Sidetree is a protocol for creating scalable [Decentralized Identifier](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) networks that can run atop any existing decentralized anchoring system (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, distributed ledgers, witness-based approaches) and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The protocol allows users to create globally unique, user-controlled identifiers and manage their associated PKI metadata, all without the need for centralized authorities or trusted third parties. The syntax of the identifier and accompanying data model used by the protocol is conformant with the [W3C Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) specification. Implementations of the protocol can be codified as their own distinct _DID Methods_ and registered in the [W3C DID Method Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/).
