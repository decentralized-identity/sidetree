## DID Operations

Sidetree-based DIDs support a variety of DID operations, all of which require the DID owner to generate specific data values and cryptographic material. The sections below describe how to perform each type of operation, and how those operations are represented in the CAS-replicated files that are anchored to the underlying ledger system.

While virtually all DID owners will engage User Agent applications on their local devices to perform these operations, most will not generate the anchoring transactions on the underlying ledger. Instead, most users will likely send the anchoring-related operation values they generate to external nodes for anchoring. This is relatively safe, because operations require signatures that an external node cannot forge. The only attack available to a rogue node operator is to not anchor the operations a DID owner sends them. However, the DID owner can detect this (via a scan of subsequent blocks) and send their operation to a different node or do it themselves, if they so desire.

::: note
  This specification does not define an API for sending public DID operation values to third-party Sidetree nodes for external anchoring, as that is an elective activity has no bearing on the technical workings of the protocol, its capabilities, or its security guarantees.
:::

Sidetree Methods MAY choose to expose protocol operation keys in the DID Document.

Sidetree Methods MAY rely on the DID Document data model when verifying protocol operations.

::: warning
  Operations other than Create contain a compact JWS. Dereferencing of key material used to verify the JWS is a DID Method specific concern. Some methods may rely of the DID Document data model, others may rely on an internal data model. Some methods may rely on `kid` of the form `did:example:123#fingerprint`, others may not include a `kid` in the JWS, or its value may be arbitrary. Support for specific `alg` fields is also DID Method specific. Implementers are cautioned to choose support for specific `alg` values carefully.

### Create

Use the following process to generate a Sidetree-based DID:

1. Generate a key pair using the defined [`KEY_ALGORITHM`](#key-algorithm), let this be known as the [operation key pair](#operation-key-pair).
2. Generate a [public key commitment](#public-key-commitment) using the defined [public key commitment scheme](#public-key-commitment-scheme) and public key of the generated [operation key pair](#operation-key-pair), let this resulting commitment be known as the [update commitment](#update-commitment).
3. Generate a canonicalized representation of the following object using the implementation's [`JSON_CANONICALIZATION_SCHEME`](#json-canonicalization-scheme), herein referred to as the [_Create Operation Delta Object_](#create-delta-object){ id="create-delta-object" }:
    ```json
    {
      "patches": [ PATCH_1, PATCH_2, ... ],
      "update_commitment": COMMITMENT_HASH
    }
    ```
    - The object ****MUST**** contain a `patches` property, and its value ****MUST**** be a JSON array of [DID State Patches](#did-state-patches).
    - The object ****MUST**** contain an `update_commitment` property, and its value ****MUST**** be the [update commitment](#update-commitment) as generated in step 2.
4. Generate a key pair using the defined [`KEY_ALGORITHM`](#key-algorithm), let this be known as the [recovery key pair](#recovery-key-pair), where the public key of this pair is used for generating the [recovery commitment](#recovery-commitment), and the private key for use in the next [recovery](#recovery) operation.
5. Generate a [public key commitment](#public-key-commitment) using the defined [public key commitment scheme](#public-key-commitment-scheme) and public key of the generated [recovery key pair](#recovery-key-pair), let this resulting commitment be known as the [recovery commitment](#recovery-commitment).
6. Generate a canonicalized representation of the following object using the implementation's [`JSON_CANONICALIZATION_SCHEME`](#json-canonicalization-scheme), herein referred to as the [_Create Operation Suffix Data Object_](#create-suffix-data-object){ id="create-suffix-data-object" }:
    ```json
    {
      "delta_hash": DELTA_HASH,
      "recovery_commitment": COMMITMENT_HASH
    }
    ```
    - The object ****MUST**** contain a `delta_hash` property, and its value ****MUST**** be a hash of the canonicalized [_Create Operation Delta Object_](#create-delta-object) (detailed above), generated via the [`HASH_PROTOCOL`](#hash-protocol).
    - The object ****MUST**** contain a `recovery_commitment` property, and its value ****MUST**** be the [recovery commitment](#recovery-commitment) as generated in step 2.

::: note
Implementations ****MAY**** choose to define additional properties for inclusion in the [_Create Operation Suffix Data Object_](#create-suffix-data-object), but the presence of any properties beyond the standard properties or implementation-defined properties ****ARE NOT**** permitted.
