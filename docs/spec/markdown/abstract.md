## Abstract

Sidetree is a protocol for creating scalable 'Layer 2' Decentralized Identifier/DPKI networks that can run atop any decentralized ledger system (e.g. Bitcoin) and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying ledger they utilize. Identifiers and PKI metadata in the protocol are expressed via the emerging [W3C Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) standard. Implementations of the protocol can be codified as their own distinct _DID Methods_ in the [W3C DID Method Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/). _DID Methods_ are deterministic mechanisms for creating unique, user-owned identifiers (`did:method:123`) and managing their associated PKI metadata (represented in the _DID Document_ data format), all without the need for centralized authorities or trusted third parties. DID Method indicators are present in DID identifier strings via unique prefixes that distinguish one from another (`did:foo:123`, `did:bar:123`, etc.); Sidetree is not a DID Method in itself, but a protocol that can be implemented atop decentralized ledgers to create DID Method implementations (e.g. `did:ion`, `did:elem`).
