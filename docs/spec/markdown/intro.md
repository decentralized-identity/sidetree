## Introduction

Decentralized ledgers (e.g. Bitcoin) introduced the first-ever solution to the linear chronological oracle problem, which unlocked the ability to create robust decentralized identifier networks. However, current approaches that utilize these ledger systems to create decentralized identifier networks suffer from severely limited transactional volumes and other performance issues. Sidetree is a 'Layer 2' protocol that runs atop decentralized ledger systems to enable scalable [W3C _Decentralized Identifier_](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) (DID) implementations that can be fully open, public, and permissionless. Sidetree is able to do all this without requiring trusted intermediaries, centralized authorities, special protocol tokens, or secondary consensus mechanisms, while preserving the core attributes of decentralization and immutability of the underlying ledger systems it is implemented on.

Architecturally, Sidetree-based DID Method implementations are overlay networks composed of independent peer nodes (_Sidetree nodes_) that observe an underlying decentralized ledger (as illustrated above), replicate DID PKI state data linked from the ledger, and execute against that data a set of deterministic protocol rules to produce an eventually strongly consistent view of all Decentralized Identifiers in the network. The Sidetree protocol defines a core set of DID PKI state change _operations_, structured as delta-based Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (i.e. [Create](#create), [Update](#update), [Recover](#recover), or [Deactivate](#deactivate)), that mutate a Decentralized Identifier's _DID Document_ state. _Sidetree nodes_ that participate in writing operations into the overlay network do so by anchoring _Content-Addressable Storage (CAS)_ (e.g. IPFS) references to aggregated bundles of _operations_ in an underlying ledger. The ledger acts as a linear chronological sequencing oracle, which the protocol leverages to order DID PKI operations in an immutable history all observing nodes can replay and validate. It is this ability to replay the precise sequence of DID PKI state change events, and process those events using a common set of deterministic rules, that allows _Sidetree nodes_ to achieve a consistent view of DIDs and their _DID Document_ states, without requiring any additional consensus mechanism.
