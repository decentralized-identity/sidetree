## File Structures

The protocol defines the following three file structures, which house DID operation data and are designed to support key functionality to enable light node configurations, minimize permanently retained data, and ensure performant resolution of DIDs.

### Anchor File

Anchor files contain [Create](#create), [Recover](#recover), and [Deactivate](#deactivate) operation values, as well as a CAS URI for the related Sidetree Map file (detailed below). As the name suggests, Anchor files are anchored to the target ledger system via embedding a CAS URI in the ledger's transactional history.

::: example
```json
{
  "map_file_uri": CAS_URI,
  "operations": {
    "operations": {
    "create": [
      {
        "delta_hash": DELTA_HASH,
        "recovery_key": JWK_OBJECT,
        "recovery_commitment": COMMITMENT_HASH
      },
      {...}
    ],
    "recover": [
      {
        "did_suffix": SUFFIX_STRING,
        "recovery_reveal_value": REVEAL_VALUE,
        "signed_data": { // Base64URL encoded, compact JWS
            "protected": {...},
            "payload": {
                "recovery_commitment": COMMITMENT_HASH,
                "delta_hash": DELTA_HASH,
                "recovery_key": JWK_OBJECT
            },
            "signature": SIGNATURE_STRING
        }
      },
      {...}
    ],
    "deactivate": [
      {
        "did_suffix": SUFFIX_STRING,
        "recovery_reveal_value": REVEAL_VALUE,
        "signed_data": { // Base64URL encoded, compact JWS
            "protected": {...},
            "payload": {
              "did_suffix": SUFFIX_STRING,
              "recovery_reveal_value": REVEAL_VALUE
            },
            "signature": SIGNATURE_STRING
        }
      },
      {...}
    ]
  }
}
```

A valid Anchor File is a JSON document that MUST NOT exceed the [`MAX_ANCHOR_FILE_SIZE`](#max-anchor-file-size), and composed as follows:

1. The Anchor File MUST contain a [`map_file_uri`](#map-file-property){id="map-file-property"} property, and its value MUST be a _CAS URI_ for the related Map File.
2. If the set of operations to be anchored contain any [Create](#create), [Recover](#recovery), or [Deactivate](#deactivate) operations, the Anchor File MUST contain an `operations` property, and its value MUST be an object composed as follows:

  - If there are any [Create](#create) operations to be included in the Anchor File:
    1. The `operations` object MUST include a `create` property, and its value MUST be an array.

### Map File

The Map file in the Sidetree protocol contains Update operation proving data, as well as the CAS-linked Chunk file chunks.
::: example
```json
{
  "chunks": [
    { "chunk_file_uri": CHUNK_HASH },
    {...}
  ],
  "operations": {
    "update": [
      {
        "did_suffix": DID_SUFFIX,
        "update_reveal_value": REVEAL_VALUE,
        "signed_data": { // Base64URL encoded, compact JWS
            "protected": {...},
            "payload": {
              "delta_hash": DELTA_HASH
            },
            "signature": SIGNATURE_STRING
        }   
      },
      {...}
    ]
  }
}
```
:::

A valid Map File is a JSON document that MUST NOT exceed the [`MAX_MAP_FILE_SIZE`](#max-map-file-size), and composed as follows:

1. The Anchor File MUST contain a `chunks` property, and its value MUST be an array of _Chunk Entries_ for the related delta data for a given chunk of operations in the batch. Future versions of the protocol will specify a process for separating the operations in a batch into multiple _Chunk Entries_, but for this version of the protocol there MUST be only one _Chunk Entry_ present in the array. _Chunk Entry_ objects are composed as follows:
    1. The _Chunk Entry_ object MUST contain a `chunk_file_uri` property, and its value MUST be a URI representing the corresponding CAS file entry, generated via the [`CID_ALGORITHM`](#cid-algorithm).
2. If there are any [Update](#update) operations to be included in the Map File, the Map File MUST include an `operations` property, and its value MUST be an object composed as follows:
  1. The `operations` object MUST include an `update` property, and its value MUST be an array.
  2. For each [Update](#update) operation to be included in the `update` array, herein referred to as [Map File Update Entries](#map-file-update-entry), use the following process to compose and include entries:
        - The object MUST contain an `id` property, and its value MUST be the [DID Suffix](#did-suffix) of the DID the operation pertains to.
        - The object MUST contain a `update_reveal_value` property, and its value MUST be the last update [COMMITMENT_VALUE](#commitment-value).
        - The object MUST contain a `signed_data` property, and its value MUST be a [IETF RFC 7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) compliant JWS object with a signature that validates against the currently active recovery key, and contains the following payload values:
          - The object MUST contain an `delta_hash` property, and its value MUST be a hash (generated via the [`HASH_ALGORITHM`](#hash-algorithm)) of the `Base64URL` encoded [_Update Operation Data Object_](#update-data-object).

### Chunk Files

Chunk Files are JSON Documents, compressed via the [COMPRESSION_ALGORITHM](#compression-algorithm) contain Sidetree Operation source data, which are composed of delta-based CRDT entries that modify the state of a Sidetree identifier's DID Document.

For this version of the protocol, there will only exist a single Chunk File that contains all the state modifying data for all operations in the included set. Future versions of the protocol will separate the total set of included operations into multiple chunks, each with their own Chunk File.

::: example Create operation Chunk File entry
```json
{
  "deltas": [
       
    { // base64URL encoded of multibase of json.stringify-ed object
      "patches": PATCH_ARRAY,
      "update_commitment": COMMITMENT_HASH
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
:::

In this version of the protocol, Chunk Files are constructed as follows:

1. The Chunk File MUST include an `deltas` property, and its value MUST be an array containing [_Chunk File Delta Entry_](#chunk-file-patch-entry){id="chunk-file-delta-entry"} objects.
2. Each [_Chunk File Delta Entry_](#chunk-file-patch-entry) MUST be a `Base64URL` encoded object, assembled as follows:
    1. The object MUST contain a `patches` property, and its value MUST be an array of [DID State Patches](#did-state-patches).
    2. The payload MUST contain an `update_commitment` property, and its value MUST be the next _Update Commitment_ generated during the operation process associated with the type of operation being performed.

3. Each [_Chunk File Delta Entry_](#chunk-file-patch-entry) MUST be appended to the `deltas` array as follows:
    1. If any Create operations were present in the associated Anchor File, append all [_Create Operation Data Objects_](#create-data-object) in the same index order as their matching [_Anchor File Create Entry_](#anchor-file-create-entry).
    2. If any Recovery operations were present in the associated Anchor File, append all [Recovery Operation Data Objects_](#recovery-data-object) in the same index order as their matching [_Anchor File Recovery Entry_](#anchor-file-recovery-entry).
    3. If any Update operations were present in the associated Map File, append all [Update Operation Data Objects_](#update-data-object) in the same index order as their matching [_Map File Update Entry_](#map-file-update-entry).
