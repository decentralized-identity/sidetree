## Abstract

Sidetree is a protocol for creating scalable decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) networks that can run atop of any existing decentralized anchoring system (e.g. Bitcoin) and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The protocol allows users to create globally unique, user-controlled identifiers and manage their associated metadata, all without the need for centralized authorities or trusted third parties. The syntax of the identifier and accompanying data model used by the protocol is conformant to that defined by [W3C Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/). Implementations of the protocol can be codified as their own distinct _DID Methods_ and registered in the [W3C DID Method Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/).
