## DID URI Composition

DID Methods based on the Sidetree protocol all share the same identifier format. The unique identifier segment of a Sidetree-based DID, known as the [DID Suffix](#did-suffix), is derived by using the [Hashing Process](#hashing-process) to generate a hash value from the canonicalized [_Create Operation Suffix Data Object_](#create-suffix-data-object). The [DID Suffix](#did-suffix) is cryptographically bound to the initial PKI state of the DID, which means Sidetree DIDs are _self-certifying_. As a result, a person or entity who creates a Sidetree-based DID knows their unique identifier at the moment of generation, and it is cryptographic secured for instant use (for more on the instant use capabilities of Sidetree DIDs, see [Unpublished DID Resolution](#unpublished-did-resolution)).

To generate the [_Short-Form DID URI_](#short-form-did){id="short-form-did"} of a Sidetree DID, use the [Hashing Process](#hashing-process) to generate a hash of the canonicalized [_Create Operation Suffix Data Object_](#create-suffix-data-object). The following is an example of a resulting colon (`:`) separated DID URI composed of the URI scheme (`did:`), Method identifier (`sidetree:`), and unique identifier string (`EiBJz4...`):

Format of Short-form DID URI:

```html
did:METHOD:<did-suffix>
```

Example of Short-Form DID URI:

```javascript
did:sidetree:EiDahaOGH-liLLdDtTxEAdc8i-cfCz-WUcQdRJheMVNn3A
```

### Long-Form DID URIs

In many DID Methods, there is a period of time (which may be indefinite) 
between the generation of a DID and the DID operation being anchored, 
propagated, and processed in the underlying distributed ledger/storage 
network. In order to account for this, Sidetree introduces an equivalent 
variant of Sidetree-based DIDs that is _self-certifying_ and _self-resolving_, 
known as the [_Long-Form DID URI_](#long-form-did){id="long-form-did"}. 
The [_Long-Form DID URI_](#long-form-did) variant of Sidetree-based DIDs 
enables DIDs to be immediately resolvable after generation by including 
the DID's initial state data within the [_Long-Form DID URI_](#long-form-did) 
itself. Sidetree [_Long-Form DID URIs_](#long-form-did){id="long-form-did"} 
are the [_Short-Form DID URI_](#short-form-did) with an additional 
colon-separated (`:`) segment appended to the end. The value of this final 
URI segment is a canonicalized JSON data payload composed of the 
[_Create Operation Suffix_](#create-suffix-data-object) data and the 
[_Create Operation Delta_](#create-delta-object) data, encoded 
via the implementation's [`DATA_ENCODING_SCHEME`](#data-encoding-scheme). 
The [_Long-Form DID URI_](#long-form-did) data payload segment ****must not**** 
exceed 1 kilobyte in size.

Long-form DID JSON data payload:

The [_Long-Form DID URI_](#long-form-did) variant of Sidetree-based DIDs supports the following features and usage patterns:

- Resolving the DID Documents of unpublished DIDs.
- Authenticating with unpublished DIDs.
- Signing and verifying credentials signed against unpublished DIDs.
- After publication and propagation are complete, authenticating with either the [_Short-Form DID URI_](#short-form-did) or [_Long-Form DID URI_](#long-form-did).
- After publication and propagation are complete, signing and verifying credentials signed against either the [_Short-Form DID URI_](#short-form-did) or [_Long-Form DID URI_](#long-form-did).
